## Hi, I'm Tina! :blush:

### Welcome to my profile!

As a Medical Laboratory Technician in the field of medical research, I am currently seeking a career change to shift my focus towards Data Science. \
In recent years, my work has primarily involved generating and collecting data, but now, my emphasis is on enhancing my skills in data processing, analysis, and storytelling. \
With this transition, I aim to expand my professional horizons and contribute to a stronger data foundation, not only in the field of medical research but also across various industries.
