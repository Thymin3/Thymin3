I am a Clinical Data Manager and Medical Laboratory Technician with a strong passion for data and its potential to drive meaningful change. \
Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Data Science at IU Internationale Hochschule, where I am honing my skills in data analytics, Python, R, and SQL. \
